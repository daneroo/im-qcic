TODO:

- Get kubeconfig out of multipass uk8s/microk8s
- Get kubeconfig out of galois/microk8s

## Overview

The idea is to automate provisioning/setup of a local k8s cluster, and deploy qcic resources through pulumi to these clusters. I am testing this first on `galois` (*n√©e `Shannon`*)

## Multipass

New work for `microk8s` is on `multipass` (instead of Vagrant), although that seems rather slow.

```bash
multipass launch lts -n uk8s -m 8G -d 40G -c 4
multipass shell uk8s
git clone https://github.com/canonical-labs/kubernetes-tools
sudo kubernetes-tools/setup-microk8s.sh
# Dashboard doesn't work yet
# sudo kubernetes-tools/expose-dashboard.sh
multipass stop uk8s
multipass delete uk8s
multipass list
multipass purge
```

## Microk8s

Use the setup script from canonical repo.

*There is something wrong with the dashboard option...*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canonical-labs/kubernetes-tools
cd kubernetes-tools
export CHANNEL=stable
./setup-microk8s.sh
# If you'd like to expose the kubernetes dashboard, you can run the following:
./expose-dashboard.sh
```

Clean uninstall:

```bash
sudo snap unalias kubectl
sudo snap remove microk8s
```
