React components for QCIC.

## `@daneroo/qcic-react`

This library has peer dependencies on `react`,`react-dom`,
which I did not add as direct dependencies
since gatsby itself already satisfies these.

It also has a (direct) dependency on `axios`, 
which I will remove in favor of `fetch`; after I mock it in the tests,
or use an isomorphic fetch dependency.

```bash
npm i @daneroo/qcic-react
```
