Quis custodiet ipsos custodes - Who will watch the watchers


## Left Sidebar

The left sidebar navigation is automatically populated by the pages in the content folder. To sort the top level navigation, edit the `forcedNavOrder` option in the `gatsby-config.js` file.

The logo will link to the `index.mdx` page. To make the `index.mdx` page visible in the left navigation, set `ignoreIndex` to `false`.

Sub navigation items are created by making a folder with the same name as the top level `.mdx` file. The sub navigation is ordered alphabetically.
