# Overview

These are components to setup `apollo-client`'s `<Query />` and `<Subscription />` tags

- apollo-client
- `<Query />` example
- `<Subscription />` example

## Requirements

From the [apollo-boost migration doc](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/boost-migration.html),
we have the minimal apollo requirements:

```bash
npm install react-apollo graphql
npm install apollo-client apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http apollo-link-error apollo-link
```

To add subscription capabilities, we add:

```bash
npm install --save apollo-link-ws subscriptions-transport-ws
```

## My components

### apollo.js

This module exports a single (default) method `newApolloClient(httpurl,wsurl)`

## References & Prior Art

The other source for this setup was the [Hasura sample-apps](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/sample-apps).
Specifically the `react-apollo-todo`, `realtime-poll` and `realtime-chat` apps.

- realtime-poll: is the simplest, `apollo.js` exports a `client = new ApolloCLient(..)`.
- realtime-chat: uses `<ApolloConsumer />`, by wrapping the entire app in an `<ApolloProvider client={client}/>` whic is defind in it's top `index.js`
- react-apollo-todo: uses `apollo.js` which exports a `makeApolloClient` function which is invoked in the top level `routes` and conditionally invokes `makeApolloClient` when the user is logged in. It is more complex because of Auth0 authentaction, which is linked in to the `makeApolloClient` call which in turns initializez the client with headers containg the bearer token from Auth0.
