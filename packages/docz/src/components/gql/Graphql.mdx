# Overview

The only required component is `<RegisterApolloProvider />`

These are convienience components to facilitate the use 
of `react-apollo`'s `<Query />` and `<Subscription />` components.

They do not require global setup which is useful for mdx-deck and docz.

This allows us to use (and re-use) multiple client for multiple graphql endpoints.

```jsx
<RegisterApolloProvider httpurl='https://your.graphql/endpoint'>
  <Query query={your query} >
    <Your Markup />
  </Query>
  -- same for a subscription
  <Subscription subscription={your subscription query} >
    <Your Other Markup />
  </Subscription>
</RegisterApolloProvider>
```

## Modules/Components


This module exports a single (default) method `newApolloClient(httpurl,wsurl): ApolloCLient`


### &lt;RegisterApolloProvider httpurl={} /&gt;

This react component is equivalent to 
```jsx
<ApolloProvider client={registerApolloClient(httpurl)} />
```

- Creates the apollo client
- Registers it with a global registry
- wraps it children in an `<ApolloProvider />`

### apollo-client.js (internals)

This module contains:

  - `registerApolloClient(httpurl)` holds a global registry for ApolloClient objects created with it
  - `newApolloClient(httpurl)` is a factory for 'ApolloCLient' object
  - `closeAll()` closes all connections in the registry, active subscriptions will go stale. WIP. But it does actually close the connection to the server (confirmed on server)

## TODO

- Close/Reuse Websocket

## Requirements

Note:_When this moves to component library, these requirements should be `peerDependencies`._

From the [apollo-boost migration doc](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/boost-migration.html),
we have the minimal apollo requirements:

```bash
npm install react-apollo graphql graphql-tag
npm install apollo-client apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http apollo-link-error apollo-link
```

To add subscription capabilities, we add:

```bash
npm install apollo-link-ws subscriptions-transport-ws
```

## References & Prior Art

The other source for this setup was the [Hasura sample-apps](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/sample-apps).
Specifically the `react-apollo-todo`, `realtime-poll` and `realtime-chat` apps.

- realtime-poll: is the simplest, `apollo.js` exports a `client = new ApolloCLient(..)`.
- realtime-chat: uses `<ApolloConsumer />`, by wrapping the entire app in an `<ApolloProvider client={client}/>` whic is defind in it's top `index.js`
- react-apollo-todo: uses `apollo.js` which exports a `makeApolloClient` function which is invoked in the top level `routes` and conditionally invokes `makeApolloClient` when the user is logged in. It is more complex because of Auth0 authentaction, which is linked in to the `makeApolloClient` call which in turns initializez the client with headers containg the bearer token from Auth0.
