## FetchDate

This demonstrates the effect of a delayed render.

  <FetchDate />

On initial render the current time is shown.
Then a fetch to <https://time.qcic.n.imetrical.com/>, and a second render.

In gatsby the original render time is kept, 
in docz each page load produces a new _Initial Render time_
